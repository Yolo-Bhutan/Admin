Working on an eCommerce platform using Next.js as the main tool provides a powerful combination of performance, scalability, and flexibility. Next.js enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG), ensuring fast load times and improved SEO, which are crucial for online stores. With its API routes, you can seamlessly integrate payment gateways like Stripe, manage product data efficiently, and handle authentication using providers like NextAuth.js. The framework’s built-in support for dynamic routing makes it easy to create product pages, categories, and user dashboards. Additionally, leveraging React’s component-based architecture enhances code maintainability and reusability, while integration with headless CMS solutions like Sanity or Contentful allows for easy content management. Overall, using Next.js for eCommerce development results in a high-performance, user-friendly shopping experience with modern web standards.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
